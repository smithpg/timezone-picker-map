## Some weird issues

### Map areas associated with multiple timezones

Example

```json:
{
	"243,75,243,75,243,75": ["Europe/Gibraltar", "Africa/Ceuta"],
	"162,100,162,100,162,100": [
		"America/Anguilla",
		"America/Lower_Princes",
		"America/Marigot"
	],
	"160,99,160,99,160,99": ["America/St_Thomas", "America/Tortola"]
}
```

### Timezones with discontiguous map areas

Example

```json
({
	"timezone": "Europe/Moscow",
	"country": "RU",
	"pin": "302,48",
	"offset": 4,
	"points": "326,23,329,23,327,24,327,24,327,24,327,25,327,25,330,27,324,27,325,26,321,25,324,24,323,24,325,24,323,24,326,23",
	"zonename": "MSK"
},
{
	"timezone": "Europe/Moscow",
	"country": "RU",
	"pin": "302,48",
	"offset": 4,
	"points": "333,20,344,18,346,18,345,19,335,20,333,21,333,21,332,21,332,22,331,21,332,22,329,22,330,23,329,22,330,23,328,23,329,23,329,23,325,23,328,23,324,23,328,22,327,22,329,21,328,21,329,21,328,21,333,20",
	"zonename": "MSK"
},
{
	"timezone": "Europe/Moscow",
	"country": "RU",
	"pin": "302,48",
	"offset": 4,
	"points": "315,63,315,63,316,64,316,65,317,67,316,68,313,66,311,66,310,65,306,65,301,62,303,61,302,60,305,60,303,60,303,59,305,59,306,58,305,57,306,57,305,57,306,56,303,56,302,55,299,55,299,54,298,54,297,53,298,53,297,52,294,53,293,51,296,51,293,49,293,48,289,47,289,45,288,45,289,45,288,44,289,43,289,42,292,42,290,41,290,41,289,41,294,38,292,36,292,36,291,35,292,34,290,32,292,31,290,30,290,29,289,29,294,28,296,28,295,28,295,28,295,29,297,29,296,29,300,29,307,31,307,32,304,33,294,32,297,33,296,33,298,33,298,34,299,35,298,35,302,36,303,36,301,35,306,35,305,34,309,33,311,33,312,32,311,32,312,31,310,30,314,30,315,31,312,32,315,32,316,32,316,31,318,31,317,31,323,30,325,29,326,29,324,29,325,30,324,30,332,29,333,30,332,30,333,30,335,29,334,28,335,28,340,29,340,29,341,30,341,31,342,31,341,31,342,31,333,35,332,39,329,40,326,40,322,40,323,41,319,42,319,43,317,42,318,41,317,40,316,40,314,41,315,42,315,43,316,43,314,44,316,45,315,45,315,46,318,45,322,47,321,47,323,47,324,46,324,47,324,47,324,47,325,48,324,48,325,49,324,50,321,49,320,49,319,50,317,51,317,52,310,52,309,53,310,54,307,54,309,56,308,57,309,57,308,58,310,59,312,59,312,58,315,59,315,59,316,60,315,61,316,61,315,62,316,62,315,63",
	"zonename": "MSK"
})
```

### Line-shaped timezones

Some time zones have such a narrow map area that they just appear as a line and
can't be clicked.

Example:

```json
{
	"timezone": "Pacific/Honolulu",
	"country": "US",
	"pin": "31,95",
	"offset": -10,
	"points": "8,99,35,89",
	"zonename": "HST"
}
```
